    description: 14 days across the south African desert in a Land Cruiser


# The Rain Goes Down in Africa

Few months ago my friend [Florian](http://yakshav.es) invited me & [Jan-Erik](http://fnordig.de) to a 2-week road trip across the Botswana desert and Namibia. The tour was organized by Sibylle, Florian's mom, who has been living in Botswana in'n'out roughly for the past 20 years. If there was ever a time I was going explore the south-African wilderness, this was it! Needless to say, we both said yes and the adventure started right after Christmas, on the 27th.

_Note: this blog post is more of a recount of our adventures, sprinkled with a bunch of pictures, than an animal photo gallery -- for nicer shots of the wildlife we encountered, check out [Sibylle's blog](http://blog.discover-botswana.de/)_

## Day Zero: getting to Africa

My careful planning was a bit thrown off by changed plans around the family Christmas -- so instead of popping over from Nyíregyháza, I had to jump on a train in Budapest at 8AM in the morning to catch my flight from Debrecen to Munich, then onwards to Frankfurt and eventually the overnight flight to Johannesburg. Only one last short flight there to Gaborone and we were done -- eventually arriving in Botswana Friday evening. It was quite a hike! I have met up with Jan-Erik in Frankfurt, so we got to enjoy each other's company for the rest of the journey (except for the flight itself to Johannesburg, but I slept that clean through that anyway!).

* ![Our last flight leg got super delayed so we got ourselves into the lounge in Johannesburg -- the delight of being able to shower after a 10+ hour flight should never be underestimated!](/img/africa/JNB_lounge.jpg)

* ![We landed around 6 PM in Gaborone where Florian & Sibylle was already waiting for us at the airport.](/img/africa/Gaborone_airport_reunion.jpg)

Due to various delays we ended up spending most of our Friday in the Johannesburg airport. We arrived in Gaborone late in the afternoon, where Sibylle & Florian picked us up.

* ![The first wildlife sightings: three seconds after leaving the Gaborone airport terminal. We actually didn't see any monkeys after this for quite a while.](/img/africa/gaborone_monkeys.jpg)

If we wouldn't have been aware that we were in Africa proper, the monkeys chasing each other around right outside the airport terminal (and Sibylle reminding us to look out for our belongings) quickly reminded us. We hopped in the car that would be our trusty companion for the next two weeks and left for Lobatse where we would spend the night in Sibylle's house before we set out on our road trip.
