    description: 14 days across the south African desert in a Land Cruiser


# The Rain Goes Down in Africa

Few months ago my friend [Florian](http://yakshav.es) invited me & [Jan-Erik](http://fnordig.de) to a 2-week road trip across the Botswana desert and Namibia. The tour was organized by Sibylle, Florian's mom, who has been living in Botswana in'n'out roughly for the past 20 years. If there was ever a time I was going explore the south-African wilderness, this was it! Needless to say, we both said yes and the adventure started right after Christmas, on the 27th.

_Note: this blog post is more of a recount of our adventures, sprinkled with a bunch of pictures, than an animal photo gallery -- for nicer shots of the wildlife we encountered, check out [Sibylle's blog](http://blog.discover-botswana.de/)_

## Day Zero: getting to Africa

My careful planning was a bit thrown off by changed plans around the family Christmas -- so instead of popping over from Ny√≠regyh√°za, I had to jump on a train in Budapest at 8AM in the morning to catch my flight from Debrecen to Munich, then onwards to Frankfurt and eventually the overnight flight to Johannesburg. Only one last short flight there to Gaborone and we were done -- eventually arriving in Botswana Friday evening. It was quite a hike! I have met up with Jan-Erik in Frankfurt, so we got to enjoy each other's company for the rest of the journey (except for the flight itself to Johannesburg, but I slept that clean through that anyway!).

* ![The flight from Frankfurt to Johannesburg was pretty uneventful, I basically slept through it. And we actually pretty much flew past Gaborone!](/img/africa/flight_to_JNB.jpg)
* ![Our last flight leg got super delayed so we got ourselves into the lounge in Johannesburg -- the delight of being able to shower after a 10+ hour flight should never be underestimated!](/img/africa/JNB_lounge.jpg)
* ![After spending most of the Friday in Johannesburg airport, eventually we got to board our short flight (45 minutes, ~250 km) to Gaborone.](/img/africa/SA_Express_to_Botswana.jpg)
* ![We landed around 6 PM in Gaborone where Florian & Sibylle was already waiting for us at the airport.](/img/africa/Gaborone_airport_reunion.jpg)

Due to various delays we ended up spending most of our Friday in the Johannesburg airport. We arrived in Gaborone late in the afternoon, where Sibylle & Florian picked us up.

* ![The first wildlife sightings: three seconds after leaving the Gaborone airport terminal. We actually didn't see any monkeys after this for quite a while.](/img/africa/gaborone_monkeys.jpg)

If we wouldn't have been aware that we were in Africa proper, the monkeys chasing each other around right outside the airport terminal (and Sibylle reminding us to look out for our belongings) quickly reminded us. We hopped in the car that would be our trusty companion for the next two weeks and left for Lobatse where we would spend the night in Sibylle's house before we set out on our road trip.

### Lobatse

It did not take us long to learn what _"wet season"_ meant in Botswana, as soon as we set out it started raining like there was no tomorrow -- we didn't know back then these rainstorms would accompany us for the days to come.

![Rainstorms raging on our way to Lobatse](/img/africa/lobatse_rainstorm.gif)

After arriving we have washed off the dust of the road with some real Botswana lager and had a nice dinner together. As a personal favorite I frequently take Tokaji Asz√∫ (a sweet white desert wine from the Eastern region of Hungary) so I picked up an "5 puttonyos Tokaji Asz√∫ (2008)" of the Diszn√≥k≈ë winery while in Debrecen (after about 6000 miles, that's a well-traveled wine i can tell you!). We drank some of the bottle after diner and Sibylle put the rest aside for later in our Kalahari trip.

* ![St Louis, a local Botswana lager](/img/africa/botswana_lager.jpg)

* ![Welcome dinner at Sibylle's house in Lobatse](/img/africa/lobatse_dinner.jpg)

Everyone was rather tired at this point and we had a tough morning ahead of us so we turned in rather early. Sibylle gave me and Jan-Erik one of her lovely downstairs guestrooms, each, so I hunkered down, plugged in _All The Things_ to charge and went to bed.

![Sibylle's guestrooms have a minimalistic look, but they have everything you need for a good night's sleep. Their distinctive names ("Left" and "Right") encompass the german heritage of being succintly always on-point.](/img/africa/lobatse_guestroom.jpg)

The next morning my watch informed me that I "got some killer Zzz-s" and I've slept 12% more than usual. Hell yeah, _vacation izzz oonnnn!_ üòé


## Day 1: Into the Wilderness!

</video>

After a warm shower the next morning (we suspected this would be the last one for a while -- but frankly, we were not prepared) we got to have a closer look at the mansion. The semi-open indoor swimming pool and sauna we saw the night before but the balcony's view and the weaverbirds nesting on the other side of the living room window gave the place an even nicer flair.

* ![The indoor pool on the lower level of the house extends outside into the garden -- and I swear at some point I saw some koi fish swimming in it.](/img/africa/lobatse_pool.jpg)
* ![Balcony view on the garden. Quite spectacular.](/img/africa/lobatse_balcony.jpg)

After a quick breakfast we started loading the landcruiser with supplies. We are heading out on a two-week road trip across Botswana and Namibia, the first 4 days of which leads through the deserted Central Kalahari, we needed to be prepared for virtually anything.

* ![Our trusty 4WD, a Toyota Land Cruiser would be our stead for the next two weeks. Turns out, our steed had... issues. But everything in their own time.](/img/africa/landcruiser.jpg)
* ![Trays of cookies, spices, plates, tents, a cooling boxes with perishables and who knows what else. All in it goes.](/img/africa/landcruiser_packing.jpg)

Florian had warned me, that in the Kalahari we won't have any kind of reception, much less internet -- and my Google Fi subscription has decided to shun Botswana so I was looking at a _really_ disconnected vacation. I wasn't sure how I felt about that (or how the family will feel about it, being used to keeping on top of my travels through various online channels and services.) In retrospect, being disconnected was less of a problem than I expected it to be, especially in the desert. In the towns it felt more of a hindrance.


### Setting sail
We have left Lobatse somewhere around noon, armed with every possible thing we would need to survive for days in the desert -- except for two things. Fuel and water.

![Twenty liters of water per person (5 liters per day), that's a LOT of water...](/img/africa/water.gif)

We drove from Lobatse to Gaborone, and then onwards to Molepolole where got almost 200 liters of diesel (into the car and jerrycans), and then visited the local supermarket to stockpile industrial amounts of water: 5 liters per person per day ends up being quite a massive amount of water.

* ![Looks like any other Spar in any other country, but looks might be deceitful](/img/africa/superspar.jpg)
* ![Halfway through shopping the a power outage struck and the entire giant shopping complex went dark. People (including me) would continue shopping, as long as the generators would supply enough power to operate the cashiers' machines, with a guard standing in the entrance, checking if all exiting customers have actually paid for their produce.](/img/africa/superspar_dark.jpg)

This Superspar looks like a Spar, it quacks like a Spar, so you kinda' get the feeling it _is_ actually a Spar... and then the power goes bye-bye and the next thing you see is people roaming the shop with flashlights, getting that last piece of grocery or diapers in the pitch-black twilight of the giant supermarket.


### Khutse

We set out to cross the Kalahari from south to north. Most of the central Kalahari is a nature reserve, the Central Kalahari Game reserve, the south tip is a separate reserve, the Khutse Game Reserve, this was our entry point to the wilderness.

![The Khutse Game Reserve entrance/gate](/img/africa/khutse.gif)

We haven't spent much time in Khutse, our night camp were already in the Central Kalahari reserve, so after a quick gate check and paying the park fees we were on our way... well, we were supposed to be, but the car didn't start. We learned our lesson -- the hard way -- in redundancy.


### Crischa & Sascha

Sibylle told us early on into the planning that to go to the heart of the desert one must at least bring two cars, in case something would happen to one of them. This was when Crischa, Sibylle's best friend decided it was time he had introduced Sascha, his 5-year-old son to the trials of life in the desert, and they accompanied us for Sascha the Botswana part of our journey.

![Crischa and his son Sascha with their trusty Toyota Land Cruiser V6](/img/africa/Crischa_Sascha.jpg)

Crischa is a budding hunter (although, he'd mostly just affectionately refer to himself as _"a pig farmer with a giant industrial mincer"_), and in the days that followed his wit & skills have ended up saving our butt numerous times in the middle of the wilderness. We have also learned a ton, some of these learnings I'll try to share further below.


### Four days in the desert -- in a broken car

Crischa disconnected the cable from what seemed to be a faulty secondary system, but the car still wouldn't start.

![It is highly suspected that the separately installed secondary battery system caused the engine trouble, but we never actually learned what happened exactly.](/img/africa/khutse_enginefix.gif)

Seemingly the troublesome secondary circuit has completely drained & killed the main battery, so we needed to jump-start the car from Crischa's Land Cruiser. This dance would become a frequent occurrence in the following days, but we decided that this little inconvenience shouldn't spoil our quest. Nevertheless, our desert survival trip was not off to a promising start...

* ![After inspecting basically every relay and plug on the car's electrical system Crischa deduced that the battery was the culprit and brought out the big guns: hooking up his Land Cruiser to ours with a giant umbilical copper cable we managed to bring our trusty steed's engine back to life.](/img/africa/khutse_jumpstart.jpg)
* ![This dance with the jumpstart cables would become a major influence on the following days, having to perform it sometimes multiple times a day we became quite proficient (and efficient) in it.](/img/africa/florian_jumpstart.jpg)

After this short intermezzo, we were finally **in**! A few minutes into Khutse we already had our first wildlife-spotting experience, courtesy of some Red Hartebeests peacefully grazing by the roadside.

* ![The sign at the entrance of the Khutse Game Reserve informed us about the reserve's history -- the presented "virtual absence of surface water" we rarely got to experience as the wet season has came down on us with all its force during the few days of our stay, leaving puddles and deep water sinkholes in its wake.](/img/africa/khutse_park.jpg)
* ![Our first animal spotting was some gently grazing Red Hartebeests, a kind of antelope specially adopted to the arid deserts of Botswana and Namibia.](/img/africa/khutse_hartebeest.jpg)


### Khawakhwe campsite

We haven't spent too much time enjoying Khutse's hospitality, but even with that -- the several hundreds of kilometers of a drive from Lobatse and the time spent (wasted?) on stockpiling and at the park gates -- it was already past 6PM as we arrived to our campsite, at the edge of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve.

<!-- ![Khawakhwe still life](/img/africa/khawakhwe_nights.mp4) -->

Most south-African countries are 1 hour ahead of Central European time in the winter months -- 6PM here is already dusk, with at 8PM being already pitch-black (due to the cloudy skies and lack of light pollution in the desert). This campsite was one of the better ones: equipped with a (bucket-)shower and latrine ("toilet"), and a designated fireplace. We needed to pitch our tents & get the campfire running quick. Fumbling in the dark outside the camp, searching for firewood was strongly discouraged, especially in the late hours.

* ![This was one of the better-equipped campsites we went to. It featured a bucket-shower with a nice spiral woodboard privacy-curtain, and a latrine (toilet) in the similar fashion, with an actual toilet seat.](/img/africa/khawakhwe_campsite.jpg)
* ![Chrischa was well-prepared: his Land Cruiser had a fold-out rooftop tent. Not only that it took maybe a minute to set up (and tear down), but also perfect vantage point and protection against predators!](/img/africa/khawakhwe_rooftop_tent.jpg)
* ![Nothing better than lounging by the crackling fire, listening to the soothing noises of the African wilderness -- Jan-Erik agrees.](/img/africa/khawakhwe_fire.jpg)
* ![Although our our alufoil-wrapped feta cheese ended up slightly burnt in the coal, the juicy steaks were mouthwateringly satisfying after a whole day of driving.](/img/africa/khawakhwe_steak.jpg)

First night's dinner would be open-fire grilled steak & grilled cheese. Chrischa's rooftop tent literally took seconds to set up so he dove into bringing light into the darkness and we enjoyed the crackling fire and nice juicy steak late into the evening. We didn't know (although, we should have probably suspected from the piling clouds) that these luxuries we'll be missing a lot for the following nights...


## Day 2: The Heart of the Kalahari

Although it rained quite a bit on our first night, by the time we got up the thirsty desert plains have soaked up all traces of the overnight storm. The weather was nice long enough that I got to go on a quick walk (a bit further away from the camp) and record some morning nature noises: the desert felt remarkably docile.

![Panorama shot of the Central Kalahari Game reserve from our first morning in the desert](/img/africa/khawakhwe_plains.pano.jpg)

Our breakfast then was cut short by another shower rolling in, so we hastily packed and set out to cross the reserve towards the north to our next campsite. These alternating storms and blazing hot dry runs would continue for the whole day (and pretty much for the rest of our desert adventures) to provide us with plenty of adventure and excitement for the rest of the week...
